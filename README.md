# üßÆ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A real-time web-based visualization tool for sorting algorithms, built with vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. This interactive application helps you understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing step-by-step visual representations.

## üöÄ Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
cd sorting-visualizer
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## üíª Development

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To sync changes from docs/ to GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
npm run sync-docs
```

## üîç How It Works

The application uses a client-server architecture:

### Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.IO)

- The server hosts the static files and provides real-time communication through WebSockets
- Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate module in the `server/algorithms` directory
- The server processes sorting operations and emits step-by-step updates to clients
- Sorting operations can be paused and resumed through Socket.IO events

### Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + Socket.IO Client)

- The UI provides controls for array input, algorithm selection, and visualization speed
- Bars represent array elements with heights proportional to their values
- Color-coding indicates the current state of elements:
  - Blue: Default state
  - Red: Elements being compared
  - Yellow: Elements being swapped
  - Green: Sorted elements
- Real-time statistics show the number of comparisons and swaps performed

## üìñ Algorithm Details

### Bubble Sort

- Time Complexity: O(n¬≤)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- A simple comparison algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Quick Sort

- Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n¬≤) worst case
- Space Complexity: O(log n)
- Uses a divide-and-conquer strategy with a pivot element to partition the array.

### Merge Sort

- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- A stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them.

## üì± Usage

1. Enter numbers in the input field (comma-separated, max 20 elements)
2. Select a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort)
3. Choose sorting speed (Slow, Medium, or Fast)
4. Click "Start" to begin visualization
5. Use "Pause/Resume" to control the process
6. Monitor comparisons and swaps in real-time
7. Click "Randomize" to generate a new random array
